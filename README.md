India House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project aims to predict house prices in India using various machine learning regression techniques. The model is trained on a curated subset of the India Housing Prices Dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset captures diverse aspects of the Indian real estate market, including property types, pricing trends, geographic locations, and available amenities, offering valuable insights across multiple Indian states.

🚀 Key Features

Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, identify patterns, and handle missing values, followed by preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modeling.

Model Training
Implemented and compared multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost, to identify the best-performing approach.

Hyperparameter Tuning
Applied hyperparameter optimization techniques for all models, with an emphasis on Grid Search to fine-tune the XGBoost model for improved performance.

Performance Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using standard regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score, enabling a comprehensive comparison across models.
